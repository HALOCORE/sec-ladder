# Verus working notes

Read `../LearnVeri/PITFALLS.md` before debugging anything. Grep
`../LearnVeri/_VERUS_DOC_/vstd/` for exact signatures and available lemmas
instead of guessing; `../LearnVeri/microbench/` has 20 worked CVE proofs to lift
technique from.

## Running

```bash
./verus_run.py file.rs                                   # verify
./verus_run.py file.rs --crate-type=lib                  # verify a lib
./verus_run.py --compile file.rs -o out -C opt-level=3   # verify + compile
./verus_run.py --keep --compile file.rs                  # keep scratch to inspect artefacts
./verus_run.py --info                                    # resolved paths + versions
```

Clean run prints `verification results:: N verified, 0 errors`. **Always report
the obligation count** after a proof edit — a count that drops unexpectedly means
code stopped being verified, not that the proof got easier.

## Conventions

- File starts `use vstd::prelude::*;`, verified code inside `verus! { ... }`.
- Loops need **both** `invariant` and `decreases`. Verus infers neither.
- `int`/`nat` are spec-only. Exec code uses `u64`/`usize`/…; cross with `as int`.
- `spec fn` cannot be called from exec code. Mirror with an exec fn whose
  `ensures` ties back to the spec.
- `&mut` postconditions need `old(x)` / `*final(x)`, never a bare `*x`.
- Unverifiable exec code (`println!`, `get_unchecked`) → `#[verifier::external_body]`
  helper. There is no statement-level skip; smallest unit is a whole item.
- Byte literals (`b'x'`) are unsupported inside `verus!` — use `0x68` or named consts.

## The trusted computing base — count it honestly

R5's entire value proposition is "the unsafe preconditions are discharged by the
verifier". Anything the verifier *doesn't* check is TCB and must be counted and
justified. **TCB lines = every line inside:**

- `#[verifier::external_body]` function bodies
- `assume_specification` / `external_fn_specification` blocks
- `assume(...)` in proofs — **any `assume` is a red flag; justify or remove**
- `#[verifier::external]` items that are reachable from measured code
- `unsafe` blocks (which, in R5, should only ever appear inside `external_body`)

Report as: `TCB: N lines across M items`. A rung-5 cell with a large TCB is not a
win and must not be presented as one.

**Count every `external_body` item, not just the interesting one.** The pilot was
published as "TCB: one 3-line `get_unchecked` wrapper"; the true tally is **3 items**
— `get_unchecked`, `out` (the `println!` wrapper) and `main`. Under-counting is how
the pilot's fatal defect hid in plain sight: `main` being `external_body` is exactly
why no precondition was ever discharged (`.memory/02-bench-rules.md`, rule 2). An
`external_body` on a *driver* is far more dangerous than one on a leaf helper,
because it deletes call-site obligations wholesale. List them individually.

### Vacuity is the failure mode that silently ruins everything

A proof of a false or unreachable statement verifies happily. Guard against:

- **Unsatisfiable `requires`** (`requires false`, or contradictory clauses) makes
  the function verify trivially and it is never callable. Check the *call site*
  verifies too.
- **A wrong `ensures` on an `external_body` helper axiomatises a falsehood** and
  everything above it is worthless. Each such `ensures` needs a written argument
  for why it matches the real Rust semantics.
- **Trivial `ensures`** (`ensures true`, or restating an input) proves nothing.
  The postcondition must state the property the pattern is about.
- A function nobody calls, or a `spec fn` that is never `assert`ed against, is
  decoration.

The reviewer agent checks all of the above by grep + reading. See `.tasks/PROTOCOL.md`.

## Proof techniques that keep coming up

- **Representation invariant**: `spec fn well_formed(&self) -> bool` tying
  `self.buf@.len()` to the logical sizes; thread it through every method's
  `requires`/`ensures` and the constructor's `ensures`. One invariant usually
  discharges all the bounds and overflow obligations at once.
- **Compose contracts**: one fn's `ensures` should be the next fn's `requires`, so
  a pipeline verifies with no re-checking at call sites.
- **Nonlinear arithmetic** (`*`, `/` in invariants) does not auto-prove — use
  `by (nonlinear_arith)` or rephrase to avoid it.
- **`exists|...| P`** needs a `#[trigger]` and a witness in scope; often prove the
  witness `by (compute)` immediately before the `assert`.
- **`checked_add`/`checked_sub`** return `Option` and never panic — often easier
  than proving raw `+` cannot overflow.
- **Panic-freedom ≠ correctness.** Clamping an index silences the bounds panic and
  leaves the logical bug. The security property needs a *functional* `ensures`.

## The R5 unsafe-licensing idiom

vstd ships no spec for `<[T]>::get_unchecked`, so the standard move is a minimal
trusted wrapper — this is the pilot's entire TCB:

```rust
#[inline(always)]
#[verifier::external_body]                    // body trusted, not verified
fn get_unchecked(v: &Vec<u64>, i: usize) -> (r: u64)
    requires i < v.len(),                     // ...but every caller must prove this
    ensures  r == v[i as int],
{ unsafe { *v.get_unchecked(i) } }
```

For raw pointers and manual memory, use `vstd::raw_ptr` (`PointsTo` permissions),
`vstd::simple_pptr`, or `vstd::cell::PCell` rather than growing the TCB. Prefer a
vstd-provided permission model over another `external_body`.
