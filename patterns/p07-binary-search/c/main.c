/* p07 rung R1 -- driver. Its own translation unit so that `isolated` builds put
 * the kernel behind a real call. The marked region below is the C copy of the
 * shared driver loop in ../spec.md; harness/check.py normalises it and diffs it
 * against the canonical token sequence pinned there.
 *
 * The two marker comments are delimiters, not prose: harness/dloop.py raises if
 * a file carries more than one of either, because a second pair lets a decoy
 * region be diffed while the real loop goes unchecked. Do not mention them
 * anywhere else in this file.
 *
 * Both C cells -- c-gcc/c-clang (R1) and c-gcc-h/c-clang-h (R1h) -- link this
 * same driver against a different kernel.c, so the two differ in the kernel and
 * in nothing else.
 *
 * The driver allocates nothing from an attacker-controlled size: p07's payload
 * has one head word (`stride`) and a byte blob, and the blob's length is the
 * file's length. So there is no `slb_zeroed`, no `SLB_MAX_CAP` and no exit 7
 * here -- exactly as for p16, p17 and p05.
 *
 * `stride_w >= 8` is the guard, four more than p05's, because p07's window
 * header is the 8-byte `n`/`nq` pair rather than the 4-byte `nrow`/`ncol` one.
 * `adversarial-stride7.bin` attacks it.
